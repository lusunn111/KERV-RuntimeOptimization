| `kerv_down_proj_residual_rms_norm` | MLP epilogue fusion | experimental |
| `kerv_logical_kv_commit` | logical-address-only K/V commit | experimental |

`backend=auto` keeps exact native fallbacks and only selects specialized
implementations for supported batch-one BF16/FP16 layouts.

## Transformer fusion

Two model-level fusion routes are enabled by measured row-count allowlists:

- **QKV fusion:** Q, K and V share the same input, so their weights are packed
  and the three projections are executed as one GEMM.
- **Gate-Up-SwiGLU fusion:** Gate and Up share the same input; one packed GEMM
  produces both branches, followed by an in-place SiLU/multiply epilogue.

The allowlists in
`KERV-RuntimeOptimization/FlagScale/configs/kerv_libero_goal.yaml` are part of the A100
reference profile. Other dimensions fall back to the native CUDA path instead
of assuming that a Triton kernel is always faster.

## System execution

The final runtime also contains non-kernel optimizations:

- fixed-width, operatorized verification-tree templates;
- persistent prefix/tree workspaces and resident K/V cache;
- verifier, prompt and drafter CUDA Graph replay;
- shared graph memory pool and process-level warm-up;
- persistent decode/control buffers and fused CPU-GPU control transfer;
- pinned image input and asynchronous H2D copy;
- two-stream commit/next-draft overlap;
- cached prompt tokenization and asynchronous runtime logging.

Quantized W8A16, compact trees and the three experimental epilogues are not
enabled by the BF16 safe configuration.
